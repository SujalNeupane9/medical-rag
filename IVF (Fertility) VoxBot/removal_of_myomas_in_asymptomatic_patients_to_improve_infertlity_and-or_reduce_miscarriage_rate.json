        "answer": "The presence of uterine myomas does not conclusively reduce the likelihood of achieving pregnancy. However, myomectomy for cavity-distorting myomas has fair evidence supporting improved pregnancy rates and reduced risk of early pregnancy loss. Hysteroscopic myomectomy also shows improvement in clinical pregnancy rates, but there is insufficient evidence regarding its impact on live birth rates or early pregnancy loss.",

Studies indicate that myomas can impact the likelihood of pregnancy and early pregnancy loss. The surgical procedure known as myomectomy, which involves the removal of myomas, may influence pregnancy and live-birth rates in asymptomatic women of reproductive age.

For instance, one large study indicated that women with intramural fibroids larger than 5 cm had a clinical pregnancy rate of 23.3% per embryo transfer, compared to 34.1% in women without fibroids. Additionally, another study found that women with non-cavity-distorting fibroids had reduced clinical pregnancy rates and deliveries compared to controls without fibroids.

For instance, a 2.5 cm subserosal leiomyoma may have minimal impact on pregnancy outcomes, while a similar-sized submucosal leiomyoma may have a greater effect. Studies show conflicting results regarding the impact of larger leiomyomas (>2.85 cm or >3.0 cm) on reproduction, with some suggesting they negatively affect reproduction, while others indicate that leiomyomas <5 cm do not significantly impact reproductive function. Additionally, the location and number of leiomyomas are not reliable predictors of reproductive function, especially since many studies exclude women with submucosal leiomyomas.",

Of the 63 women with myomas, 19 underwent myomectomy prior to IVF. Clinical pregnancy rates were not statistically different between groups (36% for myomectomy vs 29% for intramural myoma with no myomectomy vs 36% for controls).
