There should be no space between the vaginal transducer and the ovarian cortex to avoid any bowel loop within the trajectory of the needle. External abdominal pressure or supra-pubic pressure can be applied to stabilize the ovary, moving the ovarian follicles closer to the vaginal wall to avoid multiple punctures. The puncture needle is pushed through the needle guide to the vaginal top and gently punctured through the vaginal wall to reach the nearest follicle in one movement. The operator must be familiar with the tactile resistance when the follicle/ovary is penetrated by the needle and should manipulate the transducer to produce the ultrasound image. A fingertip handle on the needle can facilitate the puncture. If there is resistance, the needle should be pulled back in one movement. Techniques for tracking the needle should be used, ensuring the needle's edging is always visible. Follicle curetting involves rotating the needle inside the follicle after aspiration of the follicular fluid, which may increase the number of recovered and mature oocytes without damaging them.
