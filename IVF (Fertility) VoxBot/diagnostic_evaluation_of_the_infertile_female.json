Ovulatory cycles are typically associated with biphasic BBT recordings, while anovulatory cycles usually show monophasic patterns. However, some women may not exhibit clear biphasic patterns despite ovulating. Short luteal phases (less than 10 days of elevated temperature) can indicate subtle ovulatory dysfunction. Despite its use, BBT testing is often deemed unreliable and is not routinely recommended, especially when menstrual history suggests regular ovulatory cycles.",

  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of an endometrial biopsy and its current recommendation status?",
    "answer": "An endometrial biopsy was historically used to evaluate the presence of secretory endometrial development during the luteal phase, indicating prior ovulation.
