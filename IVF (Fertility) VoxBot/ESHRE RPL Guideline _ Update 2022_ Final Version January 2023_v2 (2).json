There was a linear association between the amount of daily caffeine intake and the risk of multiple pregnancy losses. However, the effect of reducing caffeine intake on pregnancy outcomes was not evaluated. Additionally, the enzyme CYP1A2, responsible for caffeine metabolism, was assessed as a susceptibility gene for the effect of caffeine intake on RPL, showing a significantly increased risk of RPL only among women with homozygous CYP1A2*1F alleles. Caffeine intake did not affect RPL risk among women with other CYP1A2 genotypes.

It shows various outcomes based on different treatment combinations: \n\n1. **Aspirin**: Live birth rate decreased from 700 per 1,000 to 658 per 1,000 (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11) based on 256 participants from 2 RCTs, with moderate quality evidence.\n2. **LMWH**: Live birth rate increased from 784 per 1,000 to 964 per 1,000 (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.81) based on 453 participants from 3 RCTs, with low quality evidence.\n3. **LMWH + Aspirin**: Live birth rate slightly increased from 702 per 1,000 to 709 per 1,000 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16) based on 322 participants from 2 RCTs, with moderate quality evidence.\n4. **LMWH ± Aspirin**: Live birth rate increased from 749 per 1,000 to 802 per 1,000 (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15) based on 793 participants from 5 RCTs, with moderate quality evidence.\n5. **Comparison of LMWH vs Aspirin**: Live birth rate increased from 681 per 1,000 to 790 per 1,000 (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.45) based on 325 participants from 3 RCTs, with very low quality evidence.\n6. **LMWH + Aspirin vs Aspirin**: Live birth rate increased from 609 per 1,000 to 677 per 1,000 (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.30) based on 327 participants from 2 RCTs, with moderate quality evidence.\n7. **LMWH + Aspirin vs LMWH**: Live birth rate decreased from 723 per 1,000 to 658 per 1,000 (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.15) based on 126 participants from 1 RCT, with very low quality evidence.\n\nOverall, the use of anticoagulants appears to have varying effects on live birth rates in patients with unexplained RPL, with LMWH showing a potential increase in live birth rates compared to aspirin alone.",

    "question": "What is the effect of progesterone on miscarriage rates in women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL)?",
    "answer": "Progesterone treatment compared to no treatment/placebo shows a reduction in miscarriage rates in women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. For example, one study (Haas et al., 2019) reported a miscarriage rate of 376 per 1,000 with no treatment compared to 191 per 1,000 with progesterone, resulting in an odds ratio (OR) of 0.39, indicating a significant reduction in risk. Another study (Coomarasamy et al., 2020) found a miscarriage rate of 358 per 1,000 with no treatment versus 326 per 1,000 with progesterone, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.91, suggesting a moderate effect.
