  {
    "question": "What is the role of FSH in ovarian stimulation during IVF treatment?",
    "answer": "FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) plays a crucial role in ovarian stimulation during IVF treatment by elevating its levels above the normal threshold. This elevation allows for the selection and growth of multiple follicles instead of just one, which is typical in a natural menstrual cycle.

  },
  {
    "question": "What is FSH and its role in follicle development?",
    "answer": "FSH, or Follicle Stimulating Hormone, is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the development of ovarian follicles. It stimulates the growth and maturation of follicles in the ovaries, allowing them to reach the antral stage where they become sensitive to FSH. Without FSH exposure, follicles may not develop properly and can undergo atresia, leading to a depletion of the ovarian primordial follicle pool over time.",

    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to follicles without FSH exposure?",
    "answer": "Without FSH exposure, follicles that develop from the resting pool of primordial follicles will only reach maximum sizes of 2-3 mm and will eventually undergo atresia. This wastage process continues until around the age of 50 years when the ovarian primordial follicle pool becomes depleted.",
    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "How does FSH affect the recruitment of ovarian follicles?",
    "answer": "FSH is essential for the recruitment of ovarian follicles.

    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "What is cyclic recruitment in ovarian activity?",
    "answer": "Cyclic recruitment refers to the ovarian activity where a number of follicles present in a window of opportunity to respond to FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone). This process is variable between women and age groups, with a general decline in the number of antral follicles that can be stimulated as women age, indicating a shrinking pool of primordial follicles.",
    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "How does age affect the number of antral follicles?",
    "answer": "As a general rule, the number of antral follicles that can be stimulated declines gradually with increasing age. This decline is an expression of the shrinking pool of primordial follicles, which affects ovarian reserve and fertility potential.",

  {
    "question": "What is the significance of oocyte number in IVF?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the relationship between FSH dosage and oocyte yield?",

  {
    "question": "What strategies are being explored to improve egg number in poor responders?",
    "answer": "There is ongoing research to find methods to improve the egg number in poor responders during IVF.

However, clinically useful strategies are still awaited.",
    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors influence dose adjustments in medical treatments related to Antral Follicle Count or AMH results?",
    "answer": "Dose adjustments are likely to be limited and are dependent on the Antral Follicle Count (AFC) or Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) results. A predicted poor responder may not produce more oocytes even with a higher dosage, indicating that individual responses to treatment can vary significantly based on these factors.",
    "is_verified": 1

  {
    "question": "What role does human chorion gonadotropin (hCG) play in ovarian stimulation?",
    "answer": "Human chorion gonadotropin (hCG) is used in fertility treatments to trigger the final maturation of oocytes. However, exposure of granulosa cells to hCG can also lead to the development of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) in high responder cases. Therefore, managing hCG administration is crucial to improve safety during ovarian stimulation.",
    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the implications of reducing FSH stimulation dosage in ovarian stimulation?",
    "answer": "Reducing the FSH stimulation dosage may lead to a more controlled ovarian response, which can enhance safety and reduce the risk of developing Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) without significantly jeopardizing the overall prospects for live birth. This approach aims to balance the stimulation of oocyte production while minimizing potential health risks.",
    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the risk of OHSS be mitigated during fertility treatments?",
    "answer": "The risk of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) can be mitigated by reducing the dosage of FSH stimulation, using GnRH agonist triggers to create an endogenous LH surge instead of administering hCG, and by freezing all embryos to prevent the effects of pregnancy-derived hCG. These strategies aim to enhance safety during the ovarian stimulation process.",
    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the significance of controlling ovulation during ovarian stimulation?",
    "answer": "Controlling ovulation during ovarian stimulation is significant because fast-rising oestradiol levels can trigger an untimely LH surge, which may lead to premature ovulation before follicles have matured sufficiently. This control is essential to ensure that the follicles develop properly, maximizing the chances of successful oocyte retrieval and subsequent fertilization.",
    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "What are GnRH agonists and antagonists used for in ovarian stimulation?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How does the LH peak or hCG exposure affect granulosa cells?",

    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to LH levels during GnRH agonist suppression?",
    "answer": "During GnRH agonist suppression, the interruption of the GnRH agonist leads to LH levels dropping to nearly undetectable levels, and hCG exposure takes over the role of LH in maintaining luteal function for up to 7-9 days.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the significance of luteal phase support in IVF?",

    "question": "What is the significance of conducting a risk assessment for high response before ovarian stimulation?",
    "answer": "Conducting a risk assessment for high response before ovarian stimulation is significant because it helps identify patients who may be at increased risk for developing Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS).
