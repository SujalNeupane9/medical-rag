        "question": "What are the uses of hormonal contraception in fertility treatments?",
        "answer": "Hormonal contraception can aid in the timing of assisted reproductive technology cycles, reduce the risk of ovarian cysts at in vitro fertilization cycle initiation, and optimize visualization before hysteroscopy. It is also used for ovarian cyst prevention, preoperative management, and hormone replacement. Additionally, it treats reproductive disorders such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and hirsutism. Noncontraceptive benefits include menstrual management for conditions like dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and menstrual irregularity. In infertility treatment, hormonal contraception is used for hormonal pretreatment for in vitro fertilization (IVF), which includes menstrual cycle control, synchronization of the oocyte cohort, modification of the hormonal milieu before controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for IVF, and suppression.",

        "question": "What is the role of hormonal contraception in fertility treatments?",
        "answer": "Hormonal contraception is used as a pretreatment tool before hysteroscopy for fertility-related surgeries and can impact ovarian stimulation for IVF. It allows for the scheduling of IVF cycles, can help coordinate oocyte donors with recipients, and reduces the risk of cycle cancellations due to unintended pregnancies. Additionally, it may affect markers of ovarian reserve, necessitating cautious interpretation of tests while a woman is on hormonal contraception.",

It is used to batch IVF cycles and coordinate cycles in third-party reproductive scenarios. Studies have shown that hormonal contraception can impact outcomes such as oocyte yield, pregnancy rates, and live birth rates, and its effects on ovarian reserve markers should be interpreted with caution.",

        "question": "What is the impact of hormonal contraception on the stimulation yield of an IVF cycle?",
        "answer": "Hormonal contraception has a suppressive effect on circulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone, which may help synchronize the oocyte cohort during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). However, this suppression can also reduce the ovarian response to gonadotropins. In a study, women who used hormonal contraception before IVF required more gonadotropins than those without pretreatment, but there was no adverse effect on oocyte yield or pregnancy outcomes. A meta-analysis showed that the ongoing pregnancy rate and oocyte yield were similar for women with and without hormonal pretreatment in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist cycles. The hormonal pretreatment group had a significantly higher total gonadotropin dose and longer treatment duration, but overall, there is no strong evidence that hormonal contraception significantly decreases ovarian stimulation response.",

        "question": "What is the effect of hormonal contraception on oocyte yield in assisted reproductive technology?",
        "answer": "Studies suggest that hormonal contraception, particularly those with greater androgenic properties, may negatively affect oocyte yield. Progestins like estrane- and gonane-derived progestins are associated with decreased oocyte yield and lower antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels compared to antiandrogenic hormonal contraceptives such as drospirenone, dienogest, and trimegestone. This effect may be due to androgens interfering with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) support, leading to atresia of growing follicles. A small study indicated that egg donors on androgenic hormonal contraception had a significantly lower egg yield (11.3 oocytes) compared to those without hormonal contraception (16.6 oocytes). However, a retrospective analysis found no significant difference in clinical pregnancy rates between women taking different types of hormonal contraception before controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for in vitro fertilization (IVF).",

However, hormonal contraception administration for 12–30 days with a 5-day washout period does not affect clinical pregnancy, LB, or cumulative LB in patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for an IVF cycle. A 2017 Cochrane Review of 29 RCTs found no clear evidence of a difference in pregnancy or LB rates.
