When antibodies are formed, they can be secreted into the fluids of accessory glands like the prostate and seminal vesicles, and may cause sperm to clump together, potentially affecting fertility.",

  {
    "question": "What tests are used to detect sperm antibodies?",
    "answer": "The two most common tests for detecting sperm antibodies are the mixed agglutination reaction (MAR) and the immunobead binding test. These tests help determine the presence of antibodies that may interfere with sperm function and fertility.",
    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "How do sperm antibodies affect fertility?",
    "answer": "Sperm antibodies can affect fertility by causing sperm to clump together, which can hinder their ability to swim and reach the egg for fertilization. This immune response can create barriers to successful conception, particularly if the antibodies are present in significant amounts.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the MAR test and how is it performed?",
    "answer": "The MAR (Mixed Antiglobulin Reaction) test is performed by mixing semen with IgG- or IgA-coated latex beads or red blood cells, along with IgG or IgA antiserum on a microscope slide. The slides are then incubated and observed at 400 × magnification, counting at least 200 sperm. If antibodies are present, the sperm will clump with the coated latex beads or red blood cells; if absent, the sperm will swim freely. The WHO considers a binding level of ≥50% to be clinically significant. This test is specifically used for detecting direct antibodies in men and does not indicate the location of bead attachment to the sperm.",

  {
    "question": "What is the immunobead binding test and how does it differ from the MAR test?",
    "answer": "The immunobead binding test involves combining IgG- or IgA-coated latex beads with washed sperm on a slide, which is then read at 200 × or 400 × magnification. Unlike the MAR test, this test can provide more detailed information as it considers the number of sperm bound by beads, the type of antigen involved in binding, and the specific location of bead attachment to the sperm. It can also be used to detect antibodies in a woman's serum, follicular fluid, or cervical mucus by incubating these fluids with washed sperm that have tested negative for antibodies. This indirect test involves washing known direct antibody-negative sperm and incubating them with the bodily fluid at 37 °C for one hour.",

    "question": "What role does sperm vitality play in fertility assessments?",
    "answer": "Sperm vitality is assessed by the integrity of the plasma membrane, which serves as a biological and diagnostic indicator of sperm viability. Viable sperm have intact membranes that prevent staining, while nonviable sperm allow stains to penetrate. Vital stains such as eosin Y, trypan blue, and nigrosin are used to differentiate between viable and non-viable sperm. This assessment is crucial for determining the percentage of immotile sperm that are viable and can be used in procedures like ICSI.",

    "answer": "Semen is composed of contributions from several secretory organs, with the seminal vesicle providing 70% of its volume, while the prostate and epididymis contribute the remaining 30% equally. Ejaculation is a two-stage neuroendocrine reflex involving emission and expulsion. The initial emission into the ejaculatory duct contains a mixed secretion from the prostate and the epididymis, where matured spermatozoa originate. The first fraction of ejaculate is rich in sperm, followed by a high-volume secretion from the seminal vesicle that contains very few spermatozoa. During sexual intercourse, this sperm-rich fraction washes the cervical mucus and facilitates the transport of sperm through the uterus.",

    "question": "What are single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA?",
    "answer": "Single-strand breaks (SSBs) are breaks in one strand of the DNA helix, often resulting from various forms of DNA damage such as oxidation, alkylation, and spontaneous hydrolysis. They can be repaired relatively easily. Double-strand breaks (DSBs), on the other hand, involve breaks in both strands of the DNA helix and are more damaging to genomic integrity. They can arise from endogenous sources during DNA replication or from exogenous sources like ionizing radiation and genotoxic chemicals. Both types of breaks can negatively impact fertility and reproductive outcomes, with higher levels of DSBs being linked to recurrent miscarriages.",

    "question": "What factors contribute to sperm DNA damage?",
    "answer": "Contributing factors to sperm DNA damage include advanced paternal age, smoking, obesity, radiofrequency, electromagnetic radiation, and exposure to xenobiotics. Advanced age is associated with an increased percentage of ejaculated spermatozoa with DNA damage. Young men with cancer often exhibit poor semen quality and sperm DNA damage even before therapy, with further damage from radiation or chemotherapy depending on the duration and dose. Cigarette smoking decreases sperm count and motility, increases abnormal sperm forms, and is linked to higher levels of sperm DNA damage due to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Technically, low amounts of DNA can lead to a higher chance of allele drop out (ADO), preferential amplification (PA), formation of chimerical DNA molecules, and amplification failure. Biologically, single cell analysis may not represent the embryo's complete genetic constitution, leading to issues such as mosaicism, which is the coexistence of two or more karyotypes within the same embryo. Mosaicism is detected at higher rates during the cleavage stage compared to other stages of pre-implantation development.",

To minimize this risk, excess solution is usually aspirated from around the oocyte before plunging. An experiment showed that an excess of 0.5 μL of vitrification solution (VS) around the oocyte did not significantly impact survival rates, indicating that a slower cooling rate associated with this excess volume was not critical for survival. Instead, exposure to air when removing excess VS had a greater impact on survival rates.",

A study found that there was a significant reduction in survival (p < 0.001) when oocytes were briefly exposed to temperatures of –63.8 °C and –53.8 °C. This suggests that at these temperatures, transient devitrification occurs, and upon returning to liquid nitrogen storage, revitrification may cause further damage.

  {
    "question": "How does temperature affect the hydraulic permeability coefficient during the warming of oocytes?",
    "answer": "The hydraulic permeability coefficient is temperature-dependent, which means that the rate at which permeating cryoprotectants move out of the oocyte is slower at room temperature compared to higher temperatures. This is significant because it affects the efficiency of the warming process and the survival of the oocytes. In the study, changing the temperature of the solution to 37°C did not impact survival rates when exposure time was reduced to 1 minute, suggesting that maintaining physiological temperature during warming is beneficial for oocyte survival.",

This limits the options for error during the cryopreservation process, as the survival of the oocyte is binary—it either survives or it does not. In contrast, multicellular embryos can withstand damage to a portion of their cells and still develop successfully, which provides a greater margin for error. Additionally, the unique characteristics of oocytes, such as their low surface area to volume ratio, complicate the equilibration process with cryoprotectants, making successful cryopreservation more difficult.",

The sgRNA consists of a scaffold trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) and CRISPR RNA (crRNA). The crRNA has a spacer region that shares homology with the target DNA sequence, which is recognized by the Cas enzyme. The Cas enzyme binds to a specific sequence known as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and induces a double-strand break (DSB) in the DNA. This break can be repaired by two main pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone and often leads to gene knockouts, or homology-directed repair (HDR), which can introduce specific changes to the DNA sequence, such as gene knock-ins or point mutations.",

NHEJ is the predominant repair mechanism and utilizes the cell's native, error-prone DNA repair machinery, often resulting in small insertions or deletions (indels) that disrupt the gene, effectively knocking it out. In contrast, HDR is a more precise repair mechanism that can be used to introduce specific changes to the target DNA sequence, such as gene knock-ins or point mutations, by providing a single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssODN) template that has homology to the target region.
