    "question": "What are the reproductive and hormonal considerations for women at increased risk for hereditary gynecologic cancers?",
    "answer": "Women at risk for hereditary gynecologic cancers have unique concerns regarding fertility and hormonal health. Providers must consider the impact of these conditions on reproductive and hormonal health, including options for cancer prevention, family building, genetic testing, and management of surgical menopause. Fertility preservation strategies can help women achieve their procreative goals, and genetic testing can identify pathogenic gene variants in embryos before transfer. Hormone therapy may also be considered for women without a personal history of breast cancer.",
