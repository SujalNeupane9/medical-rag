    "question": "What is the role of immunotherapy in in vitro fertilization (IVF)?",
    "answer": "Immunotherapy in IVF aims to improve the outcomes of assisted reproductive technology (ART) for both the general ART population and specific subgroups, such as patients with recurrent miscarriage or implantation failure. The guideline evaluates the role of immunomodulating therapy in ART, although many therapies lack robust evidence from well-designed randomized controlled trials to support their use. Some immunotherapies reviewed are not associated with improved live-birth outcomes or have been insufficiently studied for definitive recommendations.",

  {
    "question": "What factors influence successful outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles?",
    "answer": "Successful outcomes in ART cycles depend on the developmental competence of transferred embryos and endometrial receptivity. Factors believed to influence endometrial receptivity include hormonal preparation of the endometrium, contractility of the myometrium, and the interaction between the embryo and endometrium, which involves immunological mechanisms. Adjuvant immunotherapies have been introduced to improve outcomes in ART cycles, particularly for patients with recurrent implantation failure and/or pregnancy loss.",
