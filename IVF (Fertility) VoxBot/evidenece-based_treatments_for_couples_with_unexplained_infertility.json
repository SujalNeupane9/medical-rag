        "question": "What is ovarian stimulation (OS) and how is it used in treating unexplained infertility?",
        "answer": "Ovarian stimulation (OS) refers to pharmacological treatment aimed at inducing the development of multiple mature ovarian follicles. It is commonly used in the treatment of unexplained infertility, often in conjunction with intrauterine insemination (IUI). The goal of OS is to improve cycle fecundity by increasing the number of oocytes available for fertilization and enhancing the number of motile sperm in the uterus during ovulation. OS can involve the use of oral medications or injectable gonadotropins.",

    {
        "question": "What are the common treatments for unexplained infertility?",
        "answer": "Common treatments for unexplained infertility include ovarian stimulation (OS) with oral medications or injectable gonadotropins, followed by intrauterine insemination (IUI). Other options may include IUI in unstimulated (natural) cycles and OS with timed intercourse. These treatments are considered empirical since no specific treatable cause is identified in unexplained infertility cases.",

OS is a broader approach that can involve multiple follicles and is often used in conjunction with IUI, whereas ovulation induction targets the restoration of ovulation in women who do not ovulate naturally.",

        "question": "What is the significance of having at least one patent fallopian tube in the evaluation of infertility?",
        "answer": "Having at least one patent fallopian tube is significant in the evaluation of infertility because it indicates that the pathway for sperm to reach the egg and for the fertilized egg to travel to the uterus is open. This is a crucial factor in determining the potential for natural conception, as blocked fallopian tubes can prevent fertilization and implantation, contributing to infertility.",
