        "question": "What is the role of tubal surgery in assisted reproductive technology?",
        "answer": "Tubal surgery plays a significant role in the management of tubal-factor infertility, which accounts for 25%–35% of female infertility cases. Surgical options are available for reparative tubal surgery, particularly for cases of obstructed fallopian tubes. The decision between surgical repair and in vitro fertilization (IVF) is influenced by various factors, including the patient's medical history and the presence of conditions such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, or endometriosis.",
