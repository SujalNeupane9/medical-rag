The EFI scores patient-related factors such as age, duration of subfertility, and history of prior pregnancy, as well as surgical factors like the function of the tubes and ovaries, and the severity of endometriosis lesions. The resulting score, which ranges from 0 to 10, correlates strongly with postoperative non-ART pregnancy rates and aids in counseling patients about their reproductive options.",

  {
    "question": "How does the EFI assist in clinical decision-making for patients post-surgery?",
    "answer": "The EFI assists in clinical decision-making by providing a score that reflects the likelihood of achieving pregnancy after surgery for endometriosis. This score can guide discussions between healthcare providers and patients regarding the best reproductive options, including whether to pursue assisted reproductive technology (ART) or other fertility management strategies. Additionally, using the EFI for patient selection can help reduce healthcare costs by optimizing the choice of treatment based on individual patient factors.",
