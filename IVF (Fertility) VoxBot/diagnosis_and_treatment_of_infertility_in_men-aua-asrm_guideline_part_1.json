    "question": "What is the relationship between male infertility and cancer risk?",
    "answer": "Studies indicate that infertile men may have a higher risk of developing certain types of cancer, particularly testicular cancer. Research has shown that subfertility increases the risk of testicular cancer, and there is a notable prevalence of testicular cancer in azoospermic men who do not produce sperm. Additionally, men presenting with infertility and abnormal semen analysis have been found to have an increased incidence of testicular cancer. Overall, there is a systematic review suggesting that male infertility is associated with an increased risk of non-malignant chronic diseases as well.",
