        "question": "What is cleavage-stage biopsy?",
        "answer": "Cleavage-stage biopsy is a procedure that involves the collection of a single blastomere from an embryo at the cleavage stage of development, specifically on Day 3. This stage is characterized by the potential of blastomeres to contribute to the embryo proper, as their commitment to either the inner cell mass (ICM) or trophectoderm (TE) is not yet firmly established. The procedure allows for the detection of meiotic errors from both parents, but it cannot estimate mitotic errors leading to chromosomal mosaicism from a single blastomere. The amount of DNA available for analysis is limited, and the expected rate of inconclusive diagnosis is lower than 10%. Rebiopsy can be performed at the blastocyst stage if necessary, and embryos can be either cultured or cryopreserved following the biopsy.",

        "question": "What is blastocyst biopsy?",
        "answer": "Blastocyst biopsy involves the collection of a multicellular section (5 to 10 cells) from a blastocyst on Days 5 to 7. This section is taken from the part of the blastocyst that will develop into the placenta and extra-embryonic membranes, while the inner cell mass (ICM), which will develop into the fetus, is kept intact. This method offers several advantages over alternative biopsy procedures, including higher reliability due to the analysis of a larger number of cells.",

Tubes may be centrifuged before storage or processing. It is acceptable to transfer biopsied cells with or without microscopic visualization. Tubing can be performed in PBS or directly in lysis buffer, depending on the PGT center's protocol requirements. Both alkaline and proteinase K/sodium dodecyl sulfate treatments are acceptable for cell lysis. A minimum of one negative control per buffer is recommended to control for contamination during each procedure of cell sample collection, especially since the contamination risk is higher when working with single cells. After tubing, samples can be stored at room temperature, cooled, or frozen based on storage duration and laboratory conditions.
