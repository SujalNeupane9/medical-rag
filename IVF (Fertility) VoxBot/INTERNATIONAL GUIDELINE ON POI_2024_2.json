Lower premenopausal AMH levels and greater declines in AMH during the menopausal transition are associated with a higher atherosclerotic risk after menopause. Estrogens positively affect ventricular myocyte contractile function and intracellular Ca2+ kinetics in coronary endothelial cells, providing antiarrhythmic effects in cardiac myocytes. Estrogen also decreases insulin resistance and protects against lipid peroxidation.

    "question": "What is POI and how does it affect women's mental health?",
    "answer": "POI stands for Primary Ovarian Insufficiency, a condition where the ovaries stop functioning normally before age 40. Women with POI are at a higher risk of experiencing depression and anxiety, particularly those with iatrogenic POI (caused by medical intervention) compared to those with non-iatrogenic POI and controls. A systematic review and meta-analysis indicated a significant correlation between POI and increased rates of depression and anxiety. Additionally, studies have shown that women undergoing risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) for ovarian cancer risk may experience a doubling of depressive symptoms shortly after surgery, with elevated levels persisting for several months. Furthermore, the use of antidepressants was found to be more common among women post-RRSO, especially those receiving hormone therapy.",

    "question": "How does RRSO impact mental health in women at risk for ovarian cancer?",
    "answer": "Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is a surgical procedure aimed at reducing the risk of ovarian cancer in women with a family history of the disease. Studies have shown mixed results regarding its impact on mental health. One study indicated that RRSO did not increase self-reported depression or antidepressant use in women at elevated risk for ovarian cancer. However, another study found that the risk of depressive symptoms doubled within three months post-surgery and remained elevated for up to a year. This suggests that while some women may not experience increased depression following RRSO, others may be significantly affected, particularly those with pre-existing mood disorders.",

There is limited data specific to the POI population, and evidence from older women is often referenced. In particular, for women with breast cancer, POI may occur due to chemotherapy or bilateral oophorectomy, and studies indicate that HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Factors influencing recurrence include family history, heredity, pathological type, stage, differentiation, extent of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. The expression of hormone receptors and body mass index (BMI) are also significant factors. For non-breast cancer survivors, such as those with Hodgkin lymphoma, the risk of breast cancer increases with radiation dose, but HRT did not appear to increase breast cancer risk in Hodgkin survivors with premature menopause.
