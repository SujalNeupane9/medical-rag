        "question": "How is a uterine septum diagnosed?",
        "answer": "The diagnosis of a uterine septum involves visualizing both the external and internal contours of the uterus. Historically, the gold standard for diagnosing M€ullerian anomalies was through concomitant laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. However, with advancements in radiology, the diagnosis has shifted to radiographic techniques. Several nonsurgical methods are available, including hysterosalpingography (HSG), standard 2-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (2D TVUS), 3-dimensional TVUS with or without saline infusion, and MRI. HSG is often the initial test for patients with infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss, but it has low diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing between septate and bicornuate uteri without visualization of the external contour. Hysteroscopy alone also cannot differentiate between these two anomalies.",
