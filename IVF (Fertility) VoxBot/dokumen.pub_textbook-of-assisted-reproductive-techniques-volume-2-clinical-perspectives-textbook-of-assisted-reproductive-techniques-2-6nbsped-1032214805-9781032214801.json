This suggests that as women age, particularly approaching this age, there is an increased initiation of follicular growth and increased follicular atresia, which can affect fertility. Therefore, IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) is recommended as the treatment of choice before the ovarian reserve is exhausted, making IVF unfeasible. It is noted that IVF is more efficient than IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) for older women, highlighting the importance of age in infertility treatments.",

        "answer": "Day 3 serum FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and E2 (Estradiol) are important hormonal markers in assessing ovarian reserve. FSH is downregulated by E2, and their levels should be interpreted together to avoid misinterpretation. Elevated E2 can falsely normalize FSH levels. Early follicular-phase FSH serves as an indirect marker of ovarian reserve, but it exhibits high variability. The sensitivity of FSH to predict poor ovarian response is better at high threshold levels, with the upper threshold of FSH varying between 8.9 and 25 IU/L. The highest FSH value obtained in a patient is considered prognostic.",

        "answer": "Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells of ovarian follicles and is an important marker for assessing ovarian response. AMH levels are gonadotropin-independent, remaining consistent throughout the menstrual cycle. Normal AMH values indicate ovarian response potential, with levels greater than 3.5 ng/mL predictive of a high response and levels under 0.75 ng/mL predictive of a low response. Lower AMH levels (<1 ng/mL) are associated with poor ovarian responses, embryo quality, and pregnancy outcomes in IVF. AMH is considered more sensitive than FSH for measuring ovarian reserve, as AMH levels decline before FSH levels rise.",

It was introduced to allow for ovarian induction (OI) without the need for exogenously administered LH, particularly in patients with elevated endogenous LH levels. The rationale was that FSH alone could enhance folliculogenesis, potentially reducing complications associated with high LH levels. The development of pFSH aimed to achieve a higher purity product, leading to the creation of Metrodin-HP, which has over 95% purity.",

It was found that both groups achieved similar oocyte maturation and fertilization rates, indicating that both FSH and hMG can be effective in this context. However, concerns exist regarding the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) associated with gonadotropins that have LH activity. The excerpt notes that while there is fear surrounding the use of LH in PCOS patients due to this risk, no prospective studies have confirmed that LH increases the risk of OHSS.

HLA-C1 binds to inhibitory KIRs (KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3), while HLA-C2 interacts with both activating (KIR2DS1) and inhibitory (KIR2DL1) receptors. The binding strength between HLA-C2 and inhibitory KIRs is greater than that of HLA-C1, leading to stronger suppression of uNK cells, which can impact pregnancy outcomes.",

        "question": "What is the relationship between maternal KIR genotypes and pregnancy disorders?",
        "answer": "The excerpt discusses how the combination of maternal KIR genotypes and paternal fetal HLA-C alleles can affect reproductive outcomes. Specifically, women with the KIR AA genotype, which lacks activating KIR, are more likely to suffer from pre-eclampsia and recurrent miscarriage (RM). If the maternal homozygous KIR AA genotype coincides with the fetus having more HLA-C2 genes than the mother, the risk of pre-eclampsia, RM, and fetal growth restriction (FGR) is further increased.",

        "answer": "The excerpt explains that HLA-C2 alleles produce exaggerated inhibition on uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, particularly through the KIR2DL1 receptor, which has a high affinity for its HLA ligand. This inhibition leads to decreased production of cytokines and angiogenic factors, which are crucial for adequate placentation and the normal course of pregnancy. Poor trophoblastic invasion resulting from this inhibition is related to the occurrence of recurrent miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, and fetal growth restriction.",

In 1972, Morgenstern and Soupart described both abdominal and vaginal approaches for oocyte recovery using a special recovery unit alongside gynecological surgery. By the late 1970s, the laparoscopic approach became routine due to its less invasive nature compared to laparotomy. Patrick Steptoe's expertise in laparoscopy led to the successful birth of Louise Brown in 1978, and subsequent modifications to the collection needle facilitated further births. In the early 1980s, IVF became globally available with laparoscopic oocyte collection, but the technique evolved to the less invasive transvaginal ultrasound-guided method, pioneered by Susan Lenz and Wilfred Feichtinger. This method proved to be as effective as laparoscopy, leading to its widespread adoption in IVF units.",

        "answer": "GnRHa (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists) have a dose-dependent effect on ovarian suppression. The duration of ovarian suppression after single implant injections of GnRHa is influenced by the dose and length of treatment. In poor-responder patients, using a mini-dose GnRHa protocol can maximize ovarian response, leading to higher peak estradiol (E2) levels, more oocytes recovered, and more embryos produced. This approach aims to balance the benefits of downregulation while enhancing ovarian response.",

It typically involves using a lower dose of FSH (150–225 IU) or a delayed start to the administration of low-dose gonadotropins, which can be delayed until the mid to late follicular phase. This approach aims to support a more physiological recruitment and selection of growing follicles, although it may result in a lower number of oocytes collected and subsequently fewer embryos obtained.",

Factors that can affect ovarian reserve include age, previous surgeries, chemotherapy, and genetics. Women are born with a fixed number of oocytes, and this number decreases over time due to atresia, which is associated with a decline in oocyte quality. The peak number of primordial follicles occurs at about 20 weeks of gestation, and by birth, there are about one to two million oocytes. This number decreases significantly by puberty and continues to decline, particularly accelerating around ages 37-38, leading to depletion at menopause, which typically occurs around age 51.",

The patient is positioned in lateral decubitus, and an assistant controls leg spasms during the procedure. Electro-stimulation involves inserting a standard probe into the rectum and orienting the electrodes anteriorly, with careful monitoring of voltage and patient reactions. If acute hypertension occurs in patients with spinal cord lesions at T6 or higher, the procedure must be halted until blood pressure is stabilized. The antegrade fraction is collected in a sterile container, and if no antegrade ejaculation is observed, indirect signs such as spasms and goose bumps may indicate retrograde ejaculation. After the procedure, the bladder is re-catheterized to collect any retrograde fraction, and the collected samples are sent to the andrology laboratory for sperm identification and preparation.",

Clinical pregnancy rates are lower in obese women, with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 showing a reduced clinical pregnancy rate (32% vs 72%, relative risk [RR] 0.44). Additionally, cycles are complicated by increased gonadotrophin requirements, difficult oocyte retrievals, fewer oocytes retrieved, impaired fertilization, and reduced embryo quality with greater fragmentation. In frozen cycles, women with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 experience a reduction in live birth rates (aRR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.48–0.92) and an increased miscarriage rate (aRR = 1.68; 95% CI 1.01–3.09).

        "question": "What are the concerns regarding embryo transfer (ET) after uterus transplantation (UTx)?",
        "answer": "There are special concerns for embryo transfer after uterus transplantation compared to normal situations. One concern is that the length of the cervix of a transplanted uterus tends to gradually increase after transplantation, with some cases showing cervical canals as long as 10 cm years after UTx. This cervical hypertrophy may be secondary to increased uterine blood flow due to a shunting of blood through the anterior portion of the internal iliac artery to the uterus, as other branches are ligated. Additionally, a transplanted uterus may be attached to the abdominal wall by adhesions, which can lead to an extreme anteflexion of the uterus.",
