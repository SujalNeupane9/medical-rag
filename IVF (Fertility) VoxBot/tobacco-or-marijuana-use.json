        "answer": "Smoking may accelerate ovarian follicular depletion, although this relationship has not been observed in all studies. Chemicals in cigarette smoke appear to accelerate follicular depletion and the loss of reproductive function. Mean basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are significantly higher in young smokers than in nonsmokers, with one study showing FSH levels were 66% higher in active smokers and 39% higher in passive smokers compared to nonsmokers. Additionally, urinary estrogen excretion during the luteal phase in smokers is about one-third of that observed in nonsmokers, possibly due to tobacco smoke constituents inhibiting granulosa cell aromatase and inducing oxidative metabolism of estrogens. Significantly lower concentrations of antimüllerian hormone (AMH) have been associated with current cigarette smoking, with studies showing AMH levels were 44% lower in current smokers compared to never-smokers. Longitudinal studies indicate that AMH levels fall more rapidly in reproductively aging women who smoke, declining 21% faster per year in smokers compared to non-smokers.
