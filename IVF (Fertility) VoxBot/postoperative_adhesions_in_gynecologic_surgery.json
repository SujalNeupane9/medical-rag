        "question": "What are the factors contributing to postoperative adhesions after laparotomy and laparoscopy?",
        "answer": "Postoperative adhesions can occur due to ischemia, desiccation, the use of fine nonreactive suture materials, and the prevention of foreign-body reaction and infection. The larger the residual amount of blood and serosanguinous fluid, the more frequently adhesions can occur. The extent of tissue injury, rather than the surgical approach, is the determining factor for adhesion formation. Risk for de novo anterior abdominal wall adhesions is likely lower after laparoscopy compared to laparotomy due to shorter abdominal incisions. Additionally, minimally invasive endoscopic surgery may lead to less tissue handling and trauma, reducing the risk of adhesion formation. The incidence of postoperative infection, which is another risk factor for adhesion formation, is lower after laparoscopy than after laparotomy. However, laparoscopy can desiccate the peritoneum, potentially increasing the risk for adhesion formation. The use of warmed humidified CO2 has been shown to decrease adhesions in a human model.",
