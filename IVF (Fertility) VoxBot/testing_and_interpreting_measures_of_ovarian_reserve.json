    },
    {
        "question": "What is ovarian reserve?",
        "answer": "Ovarian reserve refers to the quantity of oocytes (egg cells) present in the ovaries, which is different from oocyte quality that relates to the potential of a fertilized oocyte to result in a live-born infant. Female infants are born with approximately 500,000 to 1 million oocytes, and this number decreases over time due to follicular atresia and ovulation, leading to menopause.",
        "is_verified": 1
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the measures of ovarian reserve?",
        "answer": "Measures of ovarian reserve include biochemical tests and ultrasound imaging of the ovaries. Biochemical tests can be further divided into early-follicular-phase measurements of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), E2 (estradiol), or inhibin B; measurement of cycle-day-independent anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH); and provocative tests such as the clomiphene citrate challenge test (CCCT).",

    },
    {
        "question": "What hormones are associated with ovarian reserve?",
        "answer": "Inhibin B and AMH are glycoprotein hormones produced by small ovarian follicles and serve as direct measures of the follicular pool. AMH is primarily secreted by primary, preantral, and early antral follicles, while inhibin B is secreted primarily by preantral follicles. As the number of ovarian follicles declines with age, both AMH and early-follicular-phase inhibin B concentrations also decline.",
        "is_verified": 1
    },
    {
        "question": "How does decreased inhibin B affect FSH levels?",
        "answer": "Decreased inhibin B secretion lowers the level of central negative feedback, which results in increased pituitary FSH secretion. This leads to higher late-luteal and early-follicular FSH concentrations, stimulating an earlier onset of new follicular growth and increasing E2 concentrations, ultimately decreasing the length of the follicular phase and the overall menstrual cycle.",

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of basal E2 levels in screening for DOR?",
        "answer": "Basal E2 alone should not be used to screen for DOR; it only aids in interpreting a normal basal serum FSH value. An early rise in serum E2 concentrations can lower an elevated basal FSH level into the normal range, potentially causing misinterpretation of the test.",
        "is_verified": 1
    },
    {
        "question": "What does an elevated E2 level indicate when the basal FSH concentration is normal?",

    },
    {
        "question": "Why should the Clomiphene Citrate Challenge Test be abandoned?",
        "answer": "The CCCT should be abandoned because, compared with basal FSH and ultrasonographically determined antral follicle count (AFC), the clomiphene-stimulated day-10 FSH level is not superior for predicting poor ovarian response or pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF) or unassisted conception in women with infertility.",

    {
        "question": "What is AMH and its significance in assessing ovarian reserve?",
        "answer": "AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone) is a hormone produced by the ovarian follicles that serves as a sensitive measure of ovarian reserve. It tends to decline before FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) rises, making it a more reliable indicator of ovarian health compared to FSH and E2 (Estradiol) levels. AMH levels may be decreased in women using hormonal contraceptives, so results should be interpreted with caution in those patients.",

    {
        "question": "What is Antral Follicle Count (AFC) and its role in evaluating ovarian reserve?",
        "answer": "Antral Follicle Count (AFC) is the total number of antral follicles observed in both ovaries via transvaginal ultrasonography during the early-follicular phase. It is considered a reliable measure of ovarian reserve due to its low intercycle variability and high interobserver reliability in experienced centers. AFC is often used alongside AMH levels to assess a woman's reproductive potential.",

    },
    {
        "question": "How does ovarian volume relate to ovarian reserve?",
        "answer": "Ovarian volume, which tends to decline with age, can indicate ovarian reserve; however, it is not commonly used for clinical predictions due to high variability and lack of sensitivity. While it may provide some information, AFC and AMH are preferred markers for assessing ovarian reserve in clinical settings.",
        "is_verified": 1
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is AMH preferred over FSH for assessing ovarian reserve?",
        "answer": "AMH is preferred over FSH for assessing ovarian reserve because it is a more sensitive marker that declines before FSH levels rise, allowing for earlier detection of diminished ovarian reserve. High FSH levels indicate a specific marker for diminished ovarian reserve but may not detect subtle declines, making AMH testing a simpler and more effective alternative.",

        "question": "What does a low AMH level indicate in terms of ovarian response during fertility treatments?",
        "answer": "A low AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone) level indicates a suboptimal ovarian response during fertility treatments. An analysis of data showed that with extremely low AMH levels (<0.16 ng/mL), 54% of cycles were canceled, 50.7% resulted in three or fewer oocytes, and 25% had no embryos to transfer. The live birth rate was only 9.5% per cycle start, suggesting that low AMH levels can be used to counsel women about their chances of success but should not be a reason to refuse treatment.",

    {
        "question": "How predictive is AMH of pregnancy and live birth rates after IVF?",
        "answer": "AMH is only weakly predictive of pregnancy and live birth rates after IVF. While it can predict quantitative outcomes like oocyte yield and ovarian responsiveness, studies show conflicting results regarding its ability to predict qualitative outcomes such as oocyte quality and clinical pregnancy rates. Meta-analyses indicate that AMH is an important factor but is not the sole predictor, as other variables like female age, sperm quality, and embryo development also significantly influence outcomes.",

    {
        "question": "What is poor ovarian response?",
        "answer": "Poor ovarian response is identified by a reduction in follicular response to maximal stimulation during the IVF (in vitro fertilization) procedure, resulting in a reduced number of retrieved oocytes. It is defined by the presence of two of the following criteria: a low number of retrieved oocytes after stimulation, a low serum estradiol level on the day of trigger, or a high dose of gonadotropins required to achieve a certain number of follicles. This definition was proposed by a European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Working Group.",
