  },
  {
    "question": "How does obesity affect fertility treatments in women?",
    "answer": "Obesity has been linked to worse outcomes after infertility treatments. Increased BMI and abdominal obesity are associated with decreased odds of ovulation in response to clomiphene citrate. Women with obesity require higher doses of gonadotropins for ovulation induction and produce fewer follicles at a given dose. Live birth rates are greater after letrozole treatment compared to clomiphene citrate, especially in women with elevated BMI, indicating altered pathophysiology in obese women.",
    "is_verified": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the impact of insulin resistance on menstrual irregularities?",
    "answer": "Insulin resistance can lead to hyperandrogenemia through direct actions on the ovary and decreased production of hepatic sex hormone-binding globulin. This hormonal imbalance contributes to menstrual irregularities by disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What are the implications of altered ovarian responsiveness in obese women undergoing fertility treatments?",
    "answer": "Obese women undergoing fertility treatments may experience altered folliculogenesis and diminished oocyte quality, leading to higher rates of ovulatory dysfunction and requiring higher doses of medication for ovulation induction.

  },
  {
    "question": "What do studies say about the relationship between BMI and IVF outcomes?",
    "answer": "Studies using national data have shown that there is a decrease in pregnancy rates and live birth rates (LBR) with increasing BMI. However, the age-related decline in fertility has a more significant impact on LBR at older ages, indicating that delaying IVF to lose weight may be detrimental for older women with obesity.",
