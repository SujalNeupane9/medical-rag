    "answer": "Ovarian reserve refers to the capacity of the ovaries to produce eggs and is categorized into low, normal, or high levels. The excerpt discusses how different categories of ovarian reserve may affect conception rates among regularly ovulating women, particularly when controlling for factors like chronological age. It suggests that women with decreased ovarian reserve may have similar spontaneous pregnancy rates as those with normal reserve, provided they maintain regular menstrual cycles.",

    "answer": "Several retrospective studies have examined the relationship between serum Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) levels and pregnancy rates in women undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI). One study involving 3019 women under 35 years old found similar cumulative live birth rates across up to seven IUI cycles regardless of whether serum AMH levels were below or above 1 ng/ml. However, another study with 1861 gonadotropin-stimulated IUI cycles found that women with serum AMH levels below 0.7 ng/ml were significantly less likely to achieve a clinical pregnancy over six cycles compared to those with higher AMH levels. Additionally, a study of 195 couples indicated a positive correlation between serum AMH levels and cumulative pregnancy rates over three OS-IUI cycles, suggesting that higher AMH levels may be associated with better fertility outcomes.",

Additionally, markers of oxidative stress such as malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl groups (PC), and nitrotyrosine (NT) were elevated in the UI group, indicating increased oxidative damage.

Another RCT involving women with fibroids showed uncertain results regarding the improvement of clinical pregnancy rates after surgical removal of fibroids, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.44, suggesting no clear benefit. Additionally, there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a benefit of fibroid removal on miscarriage rates (OR 1.54).
