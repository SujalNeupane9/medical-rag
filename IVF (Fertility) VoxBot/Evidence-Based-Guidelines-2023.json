    "answer": "Step 1: Identify irregular cycles and clinical hyperandrogenism to make a diagnosis while excluding other causes. Step 2: If there is no clinical hyperandrogenism, test for biochemical hyperandrogenism and exclude other causes for diagnosis. Step 3: For adolescents with only irregular cycles or hyperandrogenism, ultrasound or AMH is not indicated, but they should be considered at risk of PCOS and reassessed later. For adults, perform an ultrasound for PCOM or check Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) level, and if positive, exclude other causes for diagnosis.",
